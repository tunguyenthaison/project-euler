--- 

<p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>

$$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385.$$

<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,</p>

$$(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025.$$

<p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 

  $3025 - 385 = 2640$.

<p>
  
  Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Proof is very simple, as 

$$
    1 + 2 + \ldotp + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

and 

$$
    1^2 + 2^2 + \ldotp + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$
